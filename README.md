## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Variables
- Hover States

### What I learned

I learned how to use box-shadow to add subtle depth to elements, which enhances the design visually.

I used CSS variables for colors (--yellow, --gray-500), which helps in maintaining consistency across the design and makes it easier to change values globally.

I used some aspects of BEM (Block Element Modifier)
